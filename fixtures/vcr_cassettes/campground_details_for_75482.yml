Scenery includes aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers and dark   forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find   habitat above timberline.     Towering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk   Mountain range. Unlike other mountains in the Rockies composed of granite and limestone, the Maroon Bells are made up of   metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that give the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing." recreationDescription="Nestled in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is one of the top recreation   Forests in the nation.    For hikers and backpackers, the Maroon-Snowmass Trail epitomizes the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Starting from the Snowmass   Creek Trailhead, the trail winds through aspen groves, crosses streams and switchbacks through forests. Climbing to alpine   terrain, backpackers will find high mountain lakes and a smattering of wildflowers in early summer. Designated camping sites are   located at Crater Lake or Maroon Lake about 6 miles from the trailhead. Visitors should check regulations for camping in Colorado wilderness   areas." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=75482&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
