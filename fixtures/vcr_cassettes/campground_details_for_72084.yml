Grasses, shrubs and seasonal wildflowers fill the open meadows.    Wildlife is plentiful in the park: mule deer and the majestic Rocky Mountain elk are the most commonly spotted, although black bear, coyote, bighorn sheep and moose inhabit the region as well." recreationDescription="Rocky Mountain National Park has 355 miles of hiking trails that range from flat lakeside strolls to steep mountain climbs. Visitors enjoy the park&amp;amp;#39;s various lake trails (Bear Lake, Cub Lake, Mills Lake), waterfall trails (Adams Falls, Alberta Falls, Ouzel Falls) and summit trails (Deer Mountain, Twin Sisters Peaks, Flattop Mountain).    The park offers some unforgettable scenic driving routes as well, including Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road. Trail Ridge Road reaches 12,183&amp;amp;#39; above sea level and is America&amp;amp;#39;s highest continuous highway. It climbs above the park&amp;amp;#39;s evergreen forests to its windswept alpine tundra, where visitors enjoy sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and valleys.   Driving along the historic Old Fall River Road is like motoring through an earlier era. Constructed in 1920, this steep, one-way, uphill, gravel road punctuated by switchbacks, quietly leads travelers from Horseshoe Park through the park&amp;amp;#39;s wilderness to Fall River Pass, 11,796&amp;amp;#39; above sea level.     Several visitor centers are within the park, offering ranger-led activities, education and history about the park and seasonal nighttime programs." regionName="RMR" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=72084&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
