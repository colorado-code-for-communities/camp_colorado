From downhill skiing and world-class fly fishing, to dining and shopping, there is a multitude of outdoor and indoor opportunites in this mountain town." note="" orientationDescription="Located in White River National Forest, the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness is among the 5 original Colorado wilderness areas designated by the 1964 Wilderness Act. Its scenic value exudes from its aspen groves, meadows of wildflowers, and dark forests of spruce and fir that rise up from the valleys to alpine landscapes. Here, bighorn sheep, pika, and ptarmigan find habitat above timberline.     Towering over glacial valleys at over 14,000 feet in elevation, the Maroon Bells are the most recognizable peaks in the Elk Mountains. The Maroon Bells are unique to the Rockies in that they are made up of metamorphic sedimentary mudstone that give the peaks their maroon color and unstable nature for climbing." recreationDescription="For day hikers and horseback riders, nearby Maroon Creek Trail offers a less crowded alternative to viewing the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak and the entire Maroon valley. The gentle, flat terrain offers scenic stops that are great for picnicking. Several shuttle bus stops are also available along the trail.     For hikers and backpackers seeking higher elevations, the Maroon-Snowmass Trail epitomizes the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Starting from the Snowmass Creek Trailhead, the trail winds through aspen groves, crosses streams, and switchbacks through forests. Climbing to alpine terrain, backpackers will find high mountain lakes and a smattering of wildflowers in early summer.     Designated camping sites are located at Crater Lake or Maroon Lake about 6 miles from the trailhead. Check regulations for camping in Colorado wilderness areas.    Anglers will find populations of rainbow, brook, and cutthroat trout in Maroon Creek and nearby beaver ponds." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70060&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
