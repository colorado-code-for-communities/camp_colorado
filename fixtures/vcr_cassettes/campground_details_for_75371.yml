The cabin is a few miles south of the Continental Divide on the northern end of the San Luis Valley in the Rio Grande National Forest.     Built in 1935, the two room cabin was originally used by a forest ranger who oversaw the Poncha and Bonanza Districts of what was then called the Cochetopa National Forest.    Today the cabin is a comfortable getaway for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in south central Colorado." drivingDirection="From Saguache, go north on Hwy 285 for 15 miles to Villa Grove.

The gate is located .25 miles before the cabin.   Winter access may be limited to showshoes, skis or snowmobile.
