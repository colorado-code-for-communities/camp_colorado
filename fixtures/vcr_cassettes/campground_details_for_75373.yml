Described as being more vertical than horizontal, the nearby Eagles Nest Wilderness Area, designated in 1976, is a playground of craggy cliffs, sheer rock faces, alpine lakes and deep, forested valleys.    Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live." recreationDescription="Encompassing a landscape of rivers, mountains, trails and forest roads, the White River National Forest is one of the top recreation Forests in the nation.    The area surrounding Sapphire Point Overlook provides visitors with a variety of recreational opportunities.      Dillion Reservoir is the greatest draw to the area. At 3,233 acres and 26.8 miles of shoreline, the reservoir is an ideal spot for fishing, boating and sailing. Anglers will find that the reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow and brown trout, with an occasional cutthroat trout finding its way into the lake from feeder streams.     Opportunities for hiking and biking in this area abound as well, including more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail system.     The Old Dillion Reservoir trail is a favorite among visitors. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile Range and the Continental Divide. The Old Dillon Reservoir was built in the 1930s to supply water to the original town of Dillon, which is now covered by the new Dillon Reservoir." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=75373&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
