        <detailDescription alert="" contractID="NRSO" description="Bassam Cabin is located southeast of Buena Vista, Colorado just off of Forest Roads 307 and 187. The cabin dates back to the 1920s and provides visitors with access to many recreation opportunities in the remote back country of the Aspen Ridge area. Historical research, photos and stories available at the cabin are made possible in part through a grant from the Colorado Historical Society.    The cabin was originally built around 1911 and was home to a forest guard. Early forest guards lived in tents or if they were lucky, in a cabin like the Bassam Guard Station. These men monitored grazing sheep and cattle, managed timber harvesting, apprehended poachers and wrote reports about fire, road and weather conditions." drivingDirection="From Salida, drive north on Highway 285 to Johnson Village. Go east on Highway 24/285 about 7.5 miles. Turn onto County Rd 307 and drive for 1.5 miles. Turn south onto County Road 187 and go 7 miles to Forest Road 186 (take the right fork). Drive 1 mile to Forest Development Road 186A, turn left, and go 100 yards to the cabin entrance gate." facilitiesDescription="The 14&amp;amp;#39;x 16&amp;amp;#39; cabin includes a full-sized bed, dresser, a small table with two chairs and a propane stove. A metal campfire ring and picnic table are onsite. The cabin sleeps two adults, and an additional six adults may camp outside in tents or a camper. The bunkhouse and barn are off-limits to the public    Horses may be picketed or corralled outside of the fenced area by the entrance of the cabin site. Portable corrals are permitted, but must be moved every few days to prevent damage to vegetation and soil.     Water is available at a hand pump, but guests are advised to bring extra drinking water. Limited cooking and dining utensils are provided. Guests should also bring food, matches, flashlights, bedding and other basic camp gear. Downed and dead firewood may be used for evening campfires." facility="BASSAM CABIN" facilityID="73780" fullReservationUrl="http://www.reserveamerica.com/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=73780&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire" importantInformation=" Entry to the cabin is by combination lock, which is provided in confirmation letter; call the district office at (719)539-3591 for questions Bring drinking water, bedding, an axe to collect firewood, food, flashlights, matches, etc. Hay must be certified weed-free Please bring garbage bags; this is a &amp;amp;quot;pack it in-pack it out&amp;amp;quot; facility Click here for current alerts and notices, or call ranger district Parking is limited Click here for more information on the Pike and San Isabel National Forest " latitude="38.7466667" longitude="-105.9433333" nearbyAttrctionDescription="Guests may enjoy a visit to Arkansas Headwaters State Park. The nearest pay phone is located in Johnson Village, about 15 miles away. Visitors should note that 15 miles could take nearly an hour to drive, due to narrow mountain roads." note="" orientationDescription="The cabin sits in a stand of Aspens at an approximate elevation of 9,700 feet, south of Bassam Ridge. The cabin is within the Salida Ranger District, spanning 440,000 acres of public lands in central Colorado. The Arkansas River flows through the valley and is one of Colorado&amp;amp;#39;s premiere whitewater rafting areas.     The valley is known locally as the &amp;amp;quot;Banana Belt of Colorado&amp;amp;quot; because of the generally mild temperatures and sunny days. Springtime can be deceptive with sporadic spring snowstorms occurring from March to May. During the summer months, days are warm with cool nights. Afternoon thundershowers are common during July and August. The fall months are are generally dry and sunny with cooler morning temperatures." recreationDescription="Hiking and horseback riding are highly enjoyed activities in the area. Horseback riding around the Bassam Guardstation is limited to cross-country riding. There are no established and maintained trails for horseback or hiking around this area.    Because the location is remote, many guests take advantage of the peace and serenity offered at the cabin, and spend their days bird watching and enjoying the excellent opportunities for photography.    Mountain biking is available on designated roads in the Bassam Park area and OHV riding is available on Forest roads in the Fourmile Travel Management Area. Visitors may take a day trip to the Arkansas River for fishing and whitewater rafting." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=73780&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
