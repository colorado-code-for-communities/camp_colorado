The reservoir is stocked with rainbow trout and kokanee salmon. Many visitors take advantage of Colorado&amp;amp;#39;s Free Fishing Days, held annually the first full weekend of June.    Young&amp;amp;#39;s Canyon Trail No. 546 begins at the north end of the reservoir. Hikers must cross the Florida River to access the trail; crossing is tricky during high water. The trail is very popular during hunting season." note="" orientationDescription="This lightly used campground is situated in a shady forest of Colorado blue spruce, Douglas fir and aspen trees. The swift Florida River flows next to the campground." recreationDescription="The Florida River is well known for its rainbow and brown trout fishing, but the river runs through much private land, so anglers should be careful not to trespass.    Hiking and biking are popular activities in the area. The Burnt Timber Trail No. 667 begins at Transfer Park, about a mile north of the campground.     The East Florida Road (Forest Road 597) winds steeply uphill past the campground. Lost Lake and Stump Lake Trails begin along this road, offering short, easy hikes to backcountry lakes.    The surrounding area is open to public hunting. Deer, elk and small game such as rabbits and grouse inhabit the forest." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70492&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
