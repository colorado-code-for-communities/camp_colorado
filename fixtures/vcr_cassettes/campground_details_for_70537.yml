The Continental Divide runs for 236 miles along most of the forest&amp;amp;#39;s western border, presenting a myriad of ecosystems from alpine desert to dense wilderness." drivingDirection="From South Fork, Colorado, take Highway 160 for 13 miles west, turn onto Forest Road 410 SW, and go 1.8 miles to Big Meadows Campground." facilitiesDescription="Each site has a campfire ring and picnic tables.
