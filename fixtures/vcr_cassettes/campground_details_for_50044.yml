        <detailDescription alert="" contractID="CO" description="A beautiful setting in the mountains of southern Colorado, a mild year- round climate and 800 acres of water ideal for numerous water sports are the lures of Trinidad Lake State Park. Anglers catch rainbow and cutthroat trout, largemouth bass, channel catfish, walleye, crappie and perch. The lake is popular for water skiing and windsurfing. Visitors may explore the mountain branch of the historic Santa Fe Trail in nearby Trinidad. There are great wildlife-watching opportunities at this park; turkey, coyote, and deer call the park home. Two campgrounds with 73 sites can accomodate recreational vehicles, trailers or tents. On October 15, the campground is winterized with sites 1-23, 62 and 63 open year-round on a first-come, first-serve basis. Mild fall weather and abundant winter sunshine make Trinidad Lake State Park a great off-season vacation destination. In addition to camping, some of the activities available between Labor Day and spring are hiking, ice fishing, winter wildlife watching, and hunting. Call Park for details." drivingDirection=" Heading north on I-25, take Exit 13B to West Main Street. At the first four-way stop, turn left onto Nevada.
