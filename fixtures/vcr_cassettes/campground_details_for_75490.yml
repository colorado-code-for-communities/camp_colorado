The White River National Forest was established in 1891 as the White River Plateau Timber Reserve; the second such reserve to be named in the United States. In 1905, the newly formed Forest Service was given authority of the reserve.     Long before this designation, the area was home to the Ute Indians who followed herds of elk and bison on their seasonal migrations.    Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout. Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan." recreationDescription="Encompassing a landscape of rivers, mountains, trails and forest roads, the White River National Forest is one of the top recreation forests in the nation.    Located on the shores of Green Mountain reservoir, Cow Creek Campground is a popular spot for boating, canoeing, fishing, water skiing and windsurfing.      Anglers will find populations of rainbow and brown trout, as well as kokanee salmon when casting their lines out into the water.
