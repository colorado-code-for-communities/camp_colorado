        <detailDescription alert="" contractID="CO" description=" Pearl Lake State Park is one of the most beautiful parks in the Colorado State Park system. Nestled in the mountains north of Steamboat Springs, Pearl Lake is a quiet, remote location that offers a variety of activities to visitors. The 166 acre lake has been voted one of America&amp;amp;#39;s top 25 for canoeing by Reserve America. Excellent fly and lure fishing is available, the native cutthroat trout flashing their dramatic red throats when pulled from the water. A hiking trail accesses a vast expanse of National Forest, and a wildlife viewing deck overlooks the lake. Nearly all of the 36 campsites and two yurts are sunny and have views of both the lake and surrounding mountains. " drivingDirection="From Steamboat Springs go west 2 miles on Hwy 40 to County Rd 129. Turn north and go 23 miles to Pearl Lake Rd.
