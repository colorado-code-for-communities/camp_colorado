        <detailDescription alert="" contractID="NRSO" description="Cabin campers can escape the city - and escape modern day amenities - by staying at the fully rustic, historic Crescent Mining Camp cabins. The cabins offer a true old fashioned taste of life on the mine in the 19th century, with no electricity or running water. Visitors can focus on the sounds of nature and the incredible views of the Rocky Mountains from its creekside location.    The mining camp was built in the 1890s during the boom of mining and milling in Clear Creek Canyon. Miners sought mostly gold and silver, and attracted about 50,000 residents in the valley that is now rather remote." drivingDirection="From Buena Vista, Colorado, head north about 17 miles on Highway 24. Turn left on County Road 390 heading west. Drive about 9 miles and turn south on Forest Service Road 391, the cabins will be visible immediately on the right. There are 4 cabins, and the rentable cabins will be clearly marked." facilitiesDescription="Four cabins rest on the site, but only one is available for rent at this time. Each cabin comfortably accommodates up to four guests, but two additional guests may fit. Camping outside is permitted as well. Furnishings include a cook stove, wood burning stove and an indoor picnic table.      No water or electricity is available, and no beds are provided. Guests should bring cots and plenty of water. Creek water may be boiled and treated for consumption. Other items to pack include bedding, food, lanterns, matches, cooking utensils, dish soap and a first aid kit.
