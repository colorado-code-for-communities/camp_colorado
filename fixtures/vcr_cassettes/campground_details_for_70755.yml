These  resorts stay open year round." note="" orientationDescription="In the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4  defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.    Described as being more vertical than horizontal, the nearby Eagles Nest Wilderness, designated in 1976, is a playground of   craggy cliffs, sheer rock faces, alpine lakes, and deep, forested valleys. Visitors will find foot travel across this pristine   area challenging and often strenuous, but will be rewarded with spectacular scenery.     Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations   of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many   others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live." recreationDescription="Dillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to this campground, offering 26.8 miles of shoreline. It is an ideal spot for   fishing, boating, and sailing. Anglers will find that the reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow and brown trout,   with an occasional cutthroat trout finding its way into the lake from feeder streams.     Opportunities for hiking and biking include more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail   system.     From the reservoir, the Old Dillon Reservoir trail is a favorite. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile   Range and the Continental Divide. The Old Dillon Reservoir was built in the 1930s to supply water to the original town of   Dillon, which is now covered by the new Dillon Reservoir." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70755&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
