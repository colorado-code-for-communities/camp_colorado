        <detailDescription alert="" contractID="NRSO" description="The Buckeye Recreation Area is located adjacent to Buckeye Reservoir in Montrose County, Colorado. The area is popular for camping and fishing." drivingDirection="There are several ways to drive to the Buckeye Recreation Area, all requiring driving on dirt and graveled roads that can become slick after storms.    The site can be accessed from the north via the Taylor Flat Road.   From the west the area can be accessed from either the Upper or Lower Two Mile Roads.   The primary access is through the town of Paradox, Colorado (which is just north of Highway 90). Take the paved County U5 Road at the west end of town to the forest boundary; the road then becomes the unpaved Forest Road 0371 which you take for approximately 7 miles to the Recreation Area." facilitiesDescription="The Buckeye Recreation Area is located adjacent to Buckeye Reservoir. The Recreation Area is spread out around the reservoir and consists of the Pioneer Campground (30 single family reservable campsites), a boat ramp for small fishing boats (5 HP motor limit and wakeless speed), a reservable group site, a day-use picnic area and 18 less developed dispersed campsites scattered around the reservoir. Campsites in the Pioneer Campground include graveled parking spurs, concrete picnic tables, fire rings, a utility table and access to a vault toilet." facility="BUCKEYE RECREATION AREA (CO) " facilityID="108333" fullReservationUrl="http://www.reserveamerica.com/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=108333&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire" importantInformation=" Bears do frequent the area so it is important to store food properly and keep a clean camp. Water is not available at the campground. A Colorado State Fishing License is required to fish in the reservoir. Boats on the reservoir are limited to 5 HP motors and wakeless speed. The water in the reservoir is owned by the Paradox Water Users and is primarily used for irrigation, which means on low water years the reservoir could be drained completely. Off-highway vehicles can only be used coming and going from campsites. The mailing address of this facility is Moab Ranger Station, 62 East 100 North, Moab Utah, 84532 and the physical address is Montrose County, Colorado, US. The nearest town is Paradox, Colorado.
