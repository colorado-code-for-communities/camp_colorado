These resorts stay open year round." note="" orientationDescription="In the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4  defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.    Described as being more vertical than horizontal, nearby Eagles Nest Wilderness Area, designated in 1976, is a playground of craggy cliffs, sheer rock faces, alpine lakes, and deep, forested valleys. Visitors will find foot travel across this pristine area challenging and often strenuous, but will be rewarded with spectacular scenery.     Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live." recreationDescription="Dillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to this campground. At 3,233 acres, and with 26.8 miles of shoreline, it is an ideal spot for fishing, boating, and sailing.      Anglers will find that the reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow and brown trout, with an occasional cutthroat trout finding its way into the lake from feeder streams.     Opportunities for hiking and biking in the area abound, including more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail system.     The Old Dillon Reservoir trail is a favorite. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile Range and the Continental Divide. The Old Dillon Reservoir was built in the 1930s to supply water to the original town of Dillon, which is now covered by the new Dillon Reservoir." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70500&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
