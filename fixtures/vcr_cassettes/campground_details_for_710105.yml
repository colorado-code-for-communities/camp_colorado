        <detailDescription alert="" contractID="LARC" description="Located in the foothills west of Fort Collins at an elevation of 5,430 feet, Horsetooth Reservoir is 1,900 acres of water surrounded by 2,000 acres of public land. It is popular for fishing, boating, water-skiing, and camping. This 6.5-mile reservoir is open year round and is a part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District. The purpose of this water project is to divert water from the west slope to the east slope for drinking water, irrigation, and hydropower generation. The Bureau of Reclamation is solely responsible for power generation. The agencies jointly manage water levels for irrigation, municipal, and industry use.    Recreation is managed by Larimer County Natural Resources. Park Entrance Permits and Camping Fees are required." drivingDirection="From Denver:Take I-25 north to the Harmony Road/Timnath exit (#265). Turn left (west) continuing on Harmony Road for 7 miles where it becomes County Road 38E at the Taft Hill Road intersection. Continue west on County Road 38E approximately 4 more miles to the entrance at the south end of the Reservoir. The entrance to South Bay (including campground, group use area, and swim beach) is at the south end of the reservoir.  Watch for signs. To get to Inlet Bay (including Inlet Bay Marina and Inlet Bay Campground), continue west on 38E 1 3/4 miles past the South Bay entrance.
