Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse  forests to live.    This campground sits among a sparse growth of young Lodgepole pine in a wide, flat, open valley." recreationDescription="With the headwaters of the Eagle River nearby, anglers will find pockets of solitude, casting lines for rainbow and brown   trout. The waterway was named by the local Ute Indians who thought there were as many branches of the river as there were tail   feathers on an eagle.     Several ponds south of the campground offer good fishing opportunities.     The Colorado Trail crosses within walking distance of Camp Hale, and gravel roads provide easy walking and bike paths within   the area." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70570&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
