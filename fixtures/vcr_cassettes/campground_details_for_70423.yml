Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live." recreationDescription="Renowned for its fly fishing, Fryingpan River flows below Ruedi Dam. Here, large rainbow, brown, cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful in an area nicknamed the &amp;amp;quot;toilet bowl.&amp;amp;quot; The fish feed on mysis shrimp, a small freshwater shrimp stocked in the lake.    The stretch of river from the dam down to the confluence of Fryingpan and the Roaring Fork River has been designated as Gold Medal Waters by the Colorado Wildlife Commission. Special regulations in this area include fishing only with artificial flies and lures, and releasing all trout except brown trout, with a limit of 2 fish over 14 inches.    For hikers and bikers, the Ruedi Trail, located north of the reservoir, climbs to the top of Red Table Mountain. The trailhead is located 200 feet north of the Jeep trail near the boat ramp and parking lot. This 8-mile trail gains over 3,000 feet in elevation, leading hikers to a spectacular panoramic view of the area.    Boating, swimming, and water skiing are all possible. Interpretive programs are popular activities." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70423&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
