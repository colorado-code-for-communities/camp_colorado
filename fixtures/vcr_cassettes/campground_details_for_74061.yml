Today, the Gunnison river is dammed in three places, creating three large and beautiful reservoirs to be enjoyed by visitors.     The land is characterized by semi-arid shrubland with vast expanses of sagebrush. The natural features and ecosystems of Curecanti vary greatly, with Riparian habitats, epic canyons and lush patches of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir and aspen trees." recreationDescription="Jet skiing, water skiing and canoeing are some of the many water activities available on the reservoir.    Birding is also rewarding, with chances to see the black-billed magpie.
