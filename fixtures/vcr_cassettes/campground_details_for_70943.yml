The park also offers some unforgettable scenic driving routes, including Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road. Trail Ridge Road reaches 12,183&amp;amp;#39; above sea level and is America&amp;amp;#39;s highest continuous highway. It climbs above the park&amp;amp;#39;s evergreen forests to its windswept alpine tundra, where visitors enjoy sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and valleys.    Driving along the historic Old Fall River Road is like motoring through an earlier era. Constructed in 1920, this steep, one-way, uphill, gravel road punctuated by switchbacks quietly leads travelers from Horseshoe Park through the park&amp;amp;#39;s wilderness to Fall River Pass, 11,796&amp;amp;#39; above sea level.     Several visitor centers are within the park, offering ranger-led activities, education and history about the park, and seasonal nighttime programs." regionName="RMR" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70943&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
