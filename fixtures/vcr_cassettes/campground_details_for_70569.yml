These resorts stay open year round." note="" orientationDescription="In the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the 2.3 million acre White River National Forest is a place of serenity and adventure, boasting 8 wilderness areas, 4  defined seasons, and 10 peaks surpassing 14,000 feet in elevation.     Wildlife in the area abounds. Bighorn sheep navigate rocky ridges and bull elk bugle at dusk. Scenic rivers sustain populations of cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout.  Alpine regions provide habitat for pika and ptarmigan. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live." recreationDescription="Dillon Reservoir, often referred to as Lake Dillon, is the greatest draw to this campground. At 3,233 acres and 26.8 miles of shoreline, Dillon Reservoir is an ideal spot for fishing, boating, and sailing. The reservoir supports a healthy population of rainbow trout and brown trout. Occasionally, a few cutthroat trout make their way into the lake from feeder streams.     Opportunities for hiking and biking include more than 7 paved miles of the 50-mile Summit County trail system.     From the reservoir, the Old Dillon Reservoir trail is a favorite. This short, easy trail has spectacular views of the Tenmile Range and the Continental Divide. The Old Dillon Reservoir was built in the 1930s to supply water to the original town of Dillon, which is now covered by the new Dillon Reservoir.      For those wanting a bit more solitude, hiking in the Ptarmigan Wilderness area is a wonderful escape from the crowds." regionName="F2" reservationUrl="/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70569&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire">
