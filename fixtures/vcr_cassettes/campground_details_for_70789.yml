Conveniently perched near the Charles Boustead Memorial Tunnel,  May Queen offers easy access to boating, fishing and hiking.    Incredible views of the Holy Cross and Mount Massive Wildernesses can be seen from the area, and visitors are likely to see native wildlife like chipmunks, beavers and porcupines.     The Charles Boustead Memorial Tunnel is a 5.5-mile tunnel that transports water from the Fryingpan and Roaring Fork River Basins through the Continental Divide to the Arkansas River Basin by emptying water into Turquoise Lake." drivingDirection="From Leadville, Colorado, head west on County Road 4 and follow signs to the Turquoise Lake RecreationArea." facilitiesDescription="Drinking water is available from hand pumps and vault toilets are onsite. Each site comes with a campfire ring and picnic table. No electric hookups are available.     Easy access to the lake is provided for canoes and other hand-carried boats. Trailered boats can use Matchless Boat Ramp located on the east side of Turquoise Lake." facility="MAY QUEEN" facilityID="70789" fullReservationUrl="http://www.reserveamerica.com/campsiteSearch.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=70789&amp;cmp=39-32--mcmire" importantInformation=" Be bear aware; keep all food out of sight in approved containers or locked inside your vehicle and remove all food from area after eating This is a high elevation facility, please use caution when traveling from lower elevations Limit 2 vehicles or 1 RV per single site; a $5 fee is charged for additional vehicles No firearms or fireworks allowed click here for more information on Pike and San Isabel National Forests " latitude="39.2786111" longitude="-106.4322222" nearbyAttrctionDescription="Nearby is the abandoned bed of the Colorado Midland Railroad, built in the 1890s.

Nearby is the Mount Massive Wilderness area, a 30,540 acre expanse encompassing Mount Massive, Colorado&amp;amp;#39;s second highest peak at 14,421 feet. Much of the wilderness is above timberline with many alpine plant communities and permanent snowfields." recreationDescription="Explore the 6.4-mile Turquoise Lake Trail, which parallels the shoreline of Turquoise Lake from May Queen Campground to the dam.
