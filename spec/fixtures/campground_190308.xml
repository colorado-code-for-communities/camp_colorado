It is always cool (normal mid-June to mid-August highs 70-80, normal lows 40-50 degrees Fahrenheit) and never humid. There are glorious  sunsets  with quiet, restful nights and fabulous  star gazing  . We have a  Colorado  high country setting, a peaceful mountain location bordering BLM forest land.  The  Cripple Creek/Victor  area is full of things to do -  Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine, Cripple Creek  melodrama, steam train ride between  Cripple Creek  and  Victor, Florissant Fossil Beds  National Monument, CC/Victor Gold Mining Company which is a huge commercial gold reclamation operation,  Cripple Creek  Museum, nearby  horseback riding  , hiking up Trachyte Knob adjacent to the  campground  , fishing at  Skaguay  or  Eleven Mile  reservoirs, as well as numerous casinos in Cripple Creek for your gambling pleasure. It is always fun to look for the donkeys that have roamed around Cripple Creek for years.  The  campground  is located centrally to the  Colorado Springs/Pike&amp;amp;#39;s Peak  area attractions as well as the  Royal Gorge  Country attractions, each area being 45 minutes to one hour away. Guests use us as a  base-camp  for going to these other areas. We can keep you busy for days! Our staff is able to help with reservations for our guests at numerous  Colorado Springs  and  Royal Gorge  attractions, e.g. Colorado Springs/Manitou Springs Cog Railway, Flying W Ranch in Colorado Springs, Royal Gorge Route Train, Echo Canyon or other rafting companies in the Royal Gorge area.
